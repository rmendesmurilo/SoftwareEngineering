## Step 1: Fork the Repository
1. Click **Fork** (top-right of this page)
2. This creates your own copy of the repository in your GitHub account
   
## Step 2: Add Your Folder
1. Open the `Ex1` folder in your forked repository
2. Create a new folder named `StudentID_FullName` (example: `5090428_AndrewBlakney`)
3. Upload your Visual Studio project files into this folder, including:
   - `.sln` file (solution)
