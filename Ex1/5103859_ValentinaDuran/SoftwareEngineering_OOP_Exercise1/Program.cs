            - Bob, Age: 30, Membership Level: Premium
            - Charlie, Age: 40, Membership Level: VIP

            Then the program should produce the following output when borrowing and returning books:

            Alice has reached their borrowing limit.
            Bob has reached their borrowing limit.
            Charlie has reached their borrowing limit.

            Bob, Age: 30, Level: Premium, Books Borrowed: 5
            Charlie, Age: 40, Level: VIP, Books Borrowed: 10
            Total Members: 3
            Total Books Borrowed: 18
            Alice has returned all their books.
            Bob has returned all their books.
            Charlie has returned all their books.
